# java-algorithms
This repository will contain examples of algorithms and data structures implemented in Java.

Each algorithm and data structure has its own README.md with explanations and references.

This project is inspired by [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms) project

## Data Structures
Data structures store and organize data in different ways to offer more efficient experience in many different situations.
By learning data structures, we learn how each data structure stores and organizes set of data and applies different operations.
